<p>Before I decided to go into Computer Science I studied to be a paramedic for a few months.</p>
<p>The first week we had a survival training. The teacher formed us in groups and left us on a mountain.</p>
<p>Our goal was to reach the top of the mountain without leaving any team member behind in order to receive our paramedic insignia.</p>
<p>It was memorable to see how every team member helped each other.</p>
